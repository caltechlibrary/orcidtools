She serves as Head of Research Services at the Caltech Library, leading a team of subject librarians, repository, metadata and licensing specialists to develop quality information resources, publishing and authorship services for the campus community.  She initiated the innovative Author Carpentry program at Caltech to provide training and tools in responsible, reproducible, and reuseable research publication, building capacity for all to craft the fully executable Science Paper of the Future. \n\nIn the previous position as Professor and Scholarly Communication librarian at Texas A&M, Gail led the University’s ORCID integration initiative, designed and managed the Online Access to Knowledge (OAK) fund covering authors’ open access publishing fees, and oversaw the retrospective digitization and online re-publication of many thousands of theses, dissertations, and engineering reports. She served as primary copyright specialist for campus, advising on university issues such as student copyright ownership of dissertations; submission licenses for the digital repository; and applications of fair use for teaching and course reserves. Her curriculum on academic authorship and publishing established the Library's close partnership with the Graduate School and the 'Grad Aggies' professional development series. Instruction in scholarly authoring and publishing has also been offered through professional groups such the US Electronic Thesis and Dissertations Association (USETDA) and the Texas Digital Library.\n\nGail's professional service includes membership on the Research Data Alliance-CODATA Legal Interoperability of Research Data Interest Group; the Overleaf Steering Group; and past service on ORCID Outreach Steering Committee. Gail is a member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication (JLSC) where she co-edited the 2015 special issue on data sharing, data publication, and data citation. She also serves on the License Review Committee of the Statewide California Electronic Library Consortium and performs peer review for several scholarly journals including College & Research Libraries.\n\nGail writes and speaks regularly on scholarly communication, scientific knowledge management, and research publishing topics.","visibility":"PUBLIC"},"researcher-urls":{"researcher-url":[{"url-name":{"value":"Ask A Librarian at Caltech"},"url":{"value":"http://libguides.caltech.edu/askalibrarian"}}],"visibility":"PUBLIC"},"contact-details":{"email":[{"value":"gclement@library.caltech.edu","primary":true,"current":true,"verified":true,"visibility":"PUBLIC","source":"0000-0001-5494-4806","source-client-id":null}],"address":{"country":{"value":"US","visibility":"PUBLIC"}}},"keywords":{"keyword":[{"value":"Authorship and Attribution ethics"},{"value":"Copyright education, Scholarly communication, scientific publishing"},{"value":"Research data dissemination and publication"}],"visibility":"PUBLIC"},"external-identifiers":{"external-identifier":[{"orcid":null,"external-id-orcid":null,"external-id-common-name":{"value":"Scopus Author ID"},"external-id-reference":{"value":"43461134500"},"external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=43461134500&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-source":null,"source":{"source-orcid":{"value":null,"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"},"source-date":{"value":1379608611293}}},{"orcid":null,"external-id-orcid":null,"external-id-common-name":{"value":"Scopus Author ID"},"external-id-reference":{"value":"7102259798"},"external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=7102259798&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-source":null,"source":{"source-orcid":{"value":null,"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"},"source-date":{"value":1379608611293}}},{"orcid":null,"external-id-orcid":null,"external-id-common-name":{"value":"ISNI"},"external-id-reference":{"value":"0000000063976212"},"external-id-url":{"value":"http://isni.org/isni/0000000063976212"},"external-id-source":null,"source":{"source-orcid":{"value":null,"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0412-1857","path":"0000-0003-0412-1857","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"ISNI2ORCID search and link"},"source-date":{"value":1389309956717}}},{"orcid":null,"external-id-orcid":null,"external-id-common-name":{"value":"ISNI"},"external-id-reference":{"value":"0000000137477695"},"external-id-url":{"value":"http://isni.org/isni/0000000137477695"},"external-id-source":null,"source":{"source-orcid":{"value":null,"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0412-1857","path":"0000-0003-0412-1857","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"ISNI2ORCID search and link"},"source-date":{"value":1389309938347}}}],"visibility":"PUBLIC"},"delegation":null,"scope":null},"orcid-activities":{"affiliations":{"affiliation":[{"type":"EMPLOYMENT","department-name":null,"role-title":"Head of Research Services","start-date":{"year":{"value":"2015"},"month":{"value":"04"},"day":{"value":"20"}},"end-date":null,"organization":{"name":"California Institute of Technology","address":{"city":"Pasadena","region":"CA","country":"US"},"disambiguated-organization":{"disambiguated-organization-identifier":"6469","disambiguation-source":"RINGGOLD"}},"source":{"source-orcid":{"value":null,"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5494-4806","path":"0000-0001-5494-4806","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Gail P.

METHODS Characteristics of these systems are identified and categorized in order to determine the features, functions, and policies common to both, and those that uniquely characterize one or the other system. Performing such a head-to-head comparison provides valuable information and insights to decision makers responsible for managing or overhauling their university’s ETD program. RESULTS Comparison of characteristics shows the ProQuest system and the university repository both provide functional solutions for submitting, storing, disseminating, and archive ETDs using digital technology. Yet each system also has unique characteristics that distinguish it from the other. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION The authors conclude that there is no single ‘best’ system for ETD management overall. Rather, it is up to decision makers at each institution to choose an approach that best fits their university’s values, goals and needs. Finally, the authors point out the need for a single portal for ETDs that allows for search and discovery of these unique works of scholarship wherever the full text resides. Future investigation into possible solutions for such an ETD portal would be a boon not only to universities and ETD authors, but to the broader community of researchers, students, professionals and interested citizenry who could benefit from easier access to this this growing corpus of knowledge.","work-citation":{"work-citation-type":"FORMATTED_UNSPECIFIED","citation":"Clement, GP, Rascoe, F.
